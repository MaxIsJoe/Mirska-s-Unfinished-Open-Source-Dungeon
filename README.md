###### Mirska-s-Unfinished-Open-Source-Dungeon

## What is MUD?
Mirska's Unfinished Dungeon is a top down game made in the Godot Engine for the [Miz game jam] (https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1) and had gone through several rewrites and troubles while creating it, due to the 48 hour deadline I couldn't finish on time as the game broke completely just two hours before the deadline and I haven't even finished the soundtrack/sound effects for it yet.

## Why is it open source?
Because I don't want it to be shelved like most projects I work on, especially since this game was considered "finished" with 20 levels before Godot broke the dialouge system completely.

## What is in this version?
This open source version has been stabalized and has alot of content (mostly story and levels) removed, this version is designed to be sort of like a "preview" of what I had in mind and how messy the game's code looks after all the pain i went through making this.

## Can I use your code/project for [x]?
Sure, Not sure why would you use something as horrible as this for any reason but do anything you want with this as long as you credit me so more people can laugh at my failure.

## Not all code seems to be documented, what does [X] or [Y] do?
Yes

## I know the solution for your problem! it's [solution].
I already knew what the solution was, I'm not mad at the fact that I didn't figure it out quickly. I'm mad at the fact that Godot randomly decided to break some .tres files by making enums look like strings instead of ints for no reason what-so-ever.

anyways, buy me a coffee so i can suffer longer and release more mess like this
