[center][u][b]Attacking[/b][/u][/center]

[center] There are three avaliable attacks in this game, [b]Melee[/b] and [b]Ranaged[/b], Both can be used for different situations and each one has it's own pros and cons. An Icon on the bottom right part of your screen will indicate what type of attack you habe avaliable.

Melee attacks are done by grabbing a melee weapon using M1 then moving it to your target, upon touch the enemy will get damaged based on it's minium and maximum possible damage. For example a \"GREAT SWORD\" does a minium of 6 damage and a maximum of 12 damage.
[i]Tip : You can drop melee weapons by pressing Q or NUMPAD 0.[/i]

Ranaged attacks are spell based weapons that can be casted to create great damage at the cost of lower usage amounts/ammo, To use a ranaged weapon simply pick it up like any melee weapon and it will be a part of your ghostly form then aim your mouse at your target and you'll shoot out a projectile. Note that while you're using magic you can't pick up melee weapons and you can't drop your ranaged weapons.
[i]Tip : You can use some magical weapons in your human form, use it wisely to solve puzzles.[/i]
